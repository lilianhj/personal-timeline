Personal site based on a static gulp server, built with react, react-router, and
pretty much nothin else. It's really quite a small thing. Subject to pretty constant
redesign.


#TODOS
- Make thing description naming less stupid
- disconnect from the old heroku server
- install six linter, deal with fall out
- hook up state stuff for project
